            The name <span style="color: #31eca5">Poti</span> is apparently
            linked to <span style="color: #31eca5">Phasis</span>, but the
            etymology is a matter of a scholarly dispute. "Phasis" (Greek:
            Φάσις) is first recorded in Hesiod's Theogony (c. 700 BC) as a name
            of the river, not a town. Since Erich Diehl, 1938, first suggested a
            non-Hellenic origin of the name and asserted that Phasis might have
            been a derivative of a local hydronym, several explanations have
            been proposed, linking the name to the Proto-Georgian-Zan *Poti,
            Svan *Pasid, and even to a Semitic word, meaning "a gold river"

            management concession, and to manage a new port terminal. The
            creation of a new FEZ was officially inaugurated by the President of

            Poti is situated 312 kilometres (194 mi) west of Georgia’s capital,
            Tbilisi, in a marshy delta created by the major river of western
            Georgia, the Rioni, at its entrance into the Black Sea. The city
            lies at an altitude of 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) above sea level. A
            portion of Poti's environs recovered from the marshes now
            accommodate citrus plantation. The city is surrounded by the
            Kolkheti National Park. It is flanked by the small river Kaparchina
            to the south-east and Lake Paliastomi to the south-west. Some 5
            kilometres (3 miles) to the south is the village Maltaqva, a local
            beach resort.

            The recorded history of Poti and its environments spans over 26
            centuries. In Classical antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the
            area was occupied by the Greek polis of Phasis which was established
            by the colonists from Miletus led by one Themistagoras at the very
            end of the 7th, and probably at the beginning of the 6th century BC.
            The famed Greek semi-mythological voyage of Jason and the Argonauts
            in search of the Golden Fleece would have entered Georgia at this
            port and traveled up the river to what is today Kutaisi. After many
            years of uncertainty and academic debate, the site of this
            settlement now seems to be established, thanks to underwater
            archaeology under tough conditions. Apparently the lake which the
            well-informed Ancient Greek author Strabo reported as bounding one
            side of Phasis has now engulfed it, or part of it. Yet, a series of
            questions regarding the town’s exact location and identification of
            its ruins remains open due largely to the centuries-long
            geomorphological processes of the area as the lower reaches of the
            Rioni are prone to changes of course across the wetland. Phasis
            appears to have been an important center of trade and culture in
            Colchis throughout the Classical period.[2][3] The section along the
            river Phasis was a vital component of the presumed trade route from
            India to the Black Sea, attested by Strabo and Pliny.[4] Between the
            6th and 2nd centuries BC, the town played an active role in these
            contacts. During the Third Mithridatic War, Phasis came under Roman
            control. It was where the Roman commander-in-chief Pompey, having
            crossed into Colchis from Iberia, met the legate Servilius, the
            admiral of his Euxine fleet in 65 BC.[5] After the introduction of
            Christianity, Phasis was a seat of a Greek diocese, one of whose
            bishops, Cyrus, became a Patriarch of Alexandria between 630 and 641
            AD. During the Lazic War between the Eastern Roman and Sassanid
            Iranian empires (542-562) Phasis was attacked, unsuccessfully, by
            Iranian soldiers. In the 8th century, the name Poti entered Georgian
            written sources. It remained a place of maritime trade within the
            Kingdom of Georgia and was known to medieval European travelers as
            Fasso.[6] In the 14th century, the Genoese established a trading
            factory, which proved to be short-lived.

            In 1578, Poti was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Turks, who
            knew the town as Faş, heavily fortified it and made it into one of
            their Caucasian outposts which was also home to a great slave
            market.[citation needed] A combined army of the western Georgian
            princes recovered Poti in 1640, but the town fell under the Ottoman
            sway again in 1723. Another futile attempt to dispossess the
            Ottomans of Poti was made by Russo-Georgian forces in 1770 and 1771.
            Once Russia took control of most of principal Georgian lands in the
            1800s, it again attempted to evict the Turkish garrison from Poti
            and succeeded in doing so with the help of Georgian auxiliaries
            under the command of Nino, Princess of Mingrelia in 1809, but was
            coerced to return the fortress to the Ottomans in the Treaty of
            Bucharest (1812). The next Russo-Turkish War resulted in the capture
            of Poti by Russia in 1828. (See Russian conquest of the
            Caucasus#Black Sea Coast.) The town was subordinated to the
            Governorate of Kutais and granted the status of a port town in 1858.
            The seaport was reconstructed between 1863 and 1905. In 1872, the
            town became the terminus of the Caucasian railway, whence the line
            led direct to Tiflis (Tbilisi). An imitation of Hagia Sofia Poti
            Cathedral Poti particularly grew in size and importance during the
            mayorship of Niko Nikoladze between 1894 and 1912. Considered to be
            the founding father of modern Poti, Nikoladze presided over a series
            of modernizing and construction projects, including a theatre, a
            large cathedral, two gymnasia, a power station, an oil refinery,
            etc. By 1900, Poti had become one of the major ports on the Black
            Sea, exporting most of Georgia’s manganese and coal.[7] During the
            First Russian Revolution, Poti became a scene of workers' strikes
            and barricade fighting in December 1905.[8] At the beginning of
            World War I, on November 7, 1914, the Ottoman SMS Breslau appeared
            off the port of Poti and subjected the railway yards there to a
            bombardment that lasted three-quarters of an hour, without any
            direct results.[9] During a brief period of independence in
            1918–1921 Poti was Georgia’s principal window to Europe, also
            serving as the portal of entry for successive German and British
            expeditionary forces. On May 28, 1918, a German-Georgian preliminary
            treaty of alliance was signed at Poti.

            Caucasus#Black Sea Coast.) The town was subordinated to the
            Governorate of Kutais and granted the status of a port town in 1858.
            The seaport was reconstructed between 1863 and 1905. In 1872, the
            town became the terminus of the Caucasian railway, whence the line
            led direct to Tiflis (Tbilisi). An imitation of Hagia Sofia Poti
            Cathedral Poti particularly grew in size and importance during the
            mayorship of Niko Nikoladze between 1894 and 1912. Considered to be
            the founding father of modern Poti, Nikoladze presided over a series
            of modernizing and construction projects, including a theatre, a
            large cathedral, two gymnasia, a power station, an oil refinery,
            etc. By 1900, Poti had become one of the major ports on the Black
            Sea, exporting most of Georgia’s manganese and coal.[7] During the
            First Russian Revolution, Poti became a scene of workers' strikes
            and barricade fighting in December 1905.[8] At the beginning of
            World War I, on November 7, 1914, the Ottoman SMS Breslau appeared
            off the port of Poti and subjected the railway yards there to a
            bombardment that lasted three-quarters of an hour, without any
            direct results.[9] During a brief period of independence in
            1918–1921 Poti was Georgia’s principal window to Europe, also
            serving as the portal of entry for successive German and British
            expeditionary forces. On May 28, 1918, a German-Georgian preliminary
            treaty of alliance was signed at Poti.</p>
